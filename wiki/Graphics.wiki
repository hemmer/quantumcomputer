For the graphics package, an object of type CircuitInterface (any object that implements the following interface) could be passed to the class that draws.
{{{
public interface CircuitInterface {

        //return number of gates in circuit
        public int getTotal();

	//add a gate to end of the list
	public void addGate(Gate gate);
	
	//apply the gate and set the next gate as the next one in the list
	public void apply();
	
	//apply all the gates in order
	public void applyAll();
	
	//return the nextGate
	public Gate getNextGate();

        //return the first gate in the circuit
        public Gate getFirst();

        //return the register
        public Register getRegister();
		
}
}}}
With that and the gate interface,
{{{
public interface GateInterface{
	
      	public Gate getNextGate();
	public void setNextGate(Gate a);
	
	public int getCtrl1();
	public int getCtrl2();

	public String getName();
	public int getTarget();

}
}}}
As a convention, if my gates dont have a control bit, getCtrl1(), getCtrl2 etc. will return 0.

We will also need standard Strings that are in the 'name' field. I currently just have "Hadamard"

I think you could draw a circuit with that information; but maybe not run through it. Its a start though



Feel free to change or ignore the interface
